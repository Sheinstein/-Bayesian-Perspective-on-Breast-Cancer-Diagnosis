# The Bayesian Perspective on Breast Cancer Diagnosis

`Breast cancer` is one of the major life-threatening diseases in the world today. But early diagnosis would ensure timely treatment and even recovery. Apart from medical procedures that help to identify cancer and the skit -learn library, techniques such as Bayesian inferences and stats modelling on linear models can also  be applied to predict the chance that a patient has the disease by analyzing their cell data. Furthermore, Bayesian inferences from the PYMC posterior distributions of generalized linear regression models can be made about how various parameters interact with each other. For instance, how does the texture of a tumor change as the fractal dimension of the tumor increases?  How does the compactness of the tumor relate to its texture? If the tumor is so smooth, how does that affect the chance of the patient being positive? Are there parameters that carry more importance than others? What would happen if we removed information about Area, Radius  and Perimeter of the tumor? Would the prediction be so different from the actual diagnosis? In this work, an attempt is made to answer all these questions and more derivatives by applying Bayesian Inference and informative statsmodel  to a data set on which a Logistic regression from the Scikit-Learn Library, a variation of linear models, was applied by Kaiser Moo, an experienced data enthusiast in data science. The performance metrics of the statsmodel are analyzed against those of Kaiserâ€™s logistic regression model and disparities explained.
